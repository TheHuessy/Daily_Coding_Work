## README

This repository will contain a running Python notebook with problems from the Daily Coding Problems mailing list and my solutions for each problem. Not all of them will be finished or will be solved, but the goal here is to keep a living record of my progress learning and using Python.

As an additional benefit, this repository also will be maintained purely through Git via the command line as opposed to the more beginner friendly GUI found on the website.
